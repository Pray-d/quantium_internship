## Quantum Internship - Ship's Cookies Sales Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Quantum Internship task related to analyzing Ship's Cookies sales data and providing commercial recommendations based on customer analytics.

### Task Overview

#### Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

In this task, we are required to analyze the transaction dataset provided by the client and identify customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations. The goal is to understand current purchasing trends and behaviors, particularly related to chip purchases. Key steps for this task include:

- Conducting high-level data checks, including data summaries, outlier identification, and data format validation.
- Deriving additional features like pack size and brand name.
- Defining metrics of interest to analyze customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior.
- Generating insights for forming a strategy and providing recommendations to the Category Manager, Julia.

#### Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

Task 2 extends the analysis from Task 1 to identify benchmark stores for testing the impact of trial store layouts on customer sales. The main objectives are:

- Creating a measure to compare different control stores to each trial store.
- Comparing trial and control store pairs during the trial period.
- Testing if total sales are significantly different during the trial period and identifying the drivers of change.

#### Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application

The final task involves preparing a report for the client, the Category Manager, Julia. The report should include data visualizations, key insights, recommendations, and next steps. It should follow the "Pyramid Principles" framework for effective communication. Tools like PowerPoint are recommended for creating the report.
